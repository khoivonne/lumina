### Sheares / Kent Ridge Hall

## By Cab: 

Confused about what to say to the cab driver? No worries, just remember these lines: 

### Prince George Park's (PGP R/H)

Tell the cab driver to "Go to NUH direction via South Buona Vista Road". When you see the NUH building, you will see a PGPR residence sign near the traffic light on your left. Then, tell him to follow the directions and stop at PGP foyer (you will see a big entrance to PGPR with "Prince George Park Residence" emblazoned there).

### University Town (Tembusu, Cinnamon, College of Alice and Peter Tan)

The driver should know UTown, just tell him to go via Dover Road and stop in front of NUS UTown bus stop.

### Residence Halls (Eusoff, Raffles, Temasek, Kent Ridge, King Edward VII, and Sheares)

Just tell him to go to NUS Kent Ridge campus. Once there, use the NUS campus map to find your destination hall. Don't worry, it should be easy to use the map, and you can always ask somebody in the campus; they are more than willing to help :)
